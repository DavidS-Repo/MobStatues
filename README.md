# MobStatues Plugin

## Summary
MobStatues is a powerful Minecraft plugin that allows players to create and manage decorative mob statues in Minecraft. With MobStatues, you can transform mobs into stunning statues, customize their appearance, and place them as decorative elements in your world.

## Description
MobStatues is a feature-rich plugin designed to enhance your Minecraft experience by enabling you to create and manage decorative mob statues. With MobStatues, you have the ability to turn any mob into an eye-catching statue, customize its properties, and position it as a captivating decoration in your world.

Creating a mob statue is as simple as using the `/ms` command, specifying a unique name and the desired entity type. The plugin will then spawn the chosen mob as a statue at your current location. You can create statues of various entities, from creepers and zombies to skeletons and witches.

Once created, you can easily move a statue to your current location using the `/msmove` command. This allows you to reposition the statues with ease, giving you complete control over their placement in your world.

To remove a statue, use the `/msdel` command, followed by the name of the statue you wish to remove. You can also use `/msdel` without any arguments to list all the statues you currently own. This flexibility makes managing and organizing your statues a breeze.
